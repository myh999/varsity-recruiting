# University of Waterloo Varsity Recruiting

One of my first tasks as an assistant manager in the Varsity Swim Team was to make some changes to the FAQ document regarding design and information, which was sent out to every recruit. In this folder, you will find 2 pdf files.

WarriorFAQOld.pdf: The original FAQ document

WarriorFAQRedesigned.pdf: The new FAQ document

Feel free to look over the documents. If there are any improvements that I can make, feel free to contact me at: [myhao@edu.uwaterloo.ca](mailto:myhao@edu.uwaterloo.ca)
